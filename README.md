# ROP Emporium Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to all the ROP Emporium challenges, utilizing only pwntools, gdb, and radare2. I completed these challenges on WSL2 Ubuntu-20.04 Yes, all these exploits worked inside WSL2!

## Dependencies

To run the scripts, you will need the following dependencies:
- Python 3.8.10
- Pwntools (https://github.com/Gallopsled/pwntools)
- Radare2 (https://github.com/radareorg/radare2)
- gdb gef (https://github.com/hugsy/gef)

Note that some challenges may have additional dependencies or requirements, as described in their respective README files.

## Challenges

- `callme32`
- `callme64`
- `fini`
- `fluff32`
- `fluff64`
- `pivot32`
- `pivot64`
- `ret2win32`
- `ret2win64`
- `split32`
- `split64`

Each challenge has its own directory containing the exploit script, any additional files needed, and a README file describing the challenge and my approach to solving it.

Feel free to use my solutions as a reference, but try to solve the challenges on your own first!
